#Title

###By Teddy Becker-Jacob

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load-packages, message = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r  make-plot, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
storms %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(wind = mean(wind)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = wind)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
